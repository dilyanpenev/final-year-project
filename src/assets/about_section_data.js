        description: "Photographs have the power of telling stories about people and places that we have never met or seen. Going through the old albums at my grandparentsâ€™ house, I could see photos of them when they were my age and many memorable moments of their life such as their wedding. One problem however was the lack of colour in those pictures - they were all black-and-white. This has led me to do some research about computer-aided colourization of photos."

        description: "The problem considered in this project is a deep learning task in the area of computer vision. It uses a convolutional neural network to process a black-and-white image and extract its features. Subsequently, the model uses the learnt statistical dependencies to infer the colours associated with each pixel."

        description: "The deep learning model has been trained for 10 iterations on the Imagenette dataset. A plethora of evaluation metrics have been considered in the assessment of the model's performance such as semantic interpretability, SMSS and PSNR ratios and a survey into the public opinion of the plausibility of the results."
